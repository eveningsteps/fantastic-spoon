## howto
To compile any of tasks _(haha, who in their sane mind is gonna need this very repository anyway)_:
* install [dub](https://code.dlang.org/download)
* `cd` to a, say, `ir01` and run `dub build`
  * You may also try executing `dub build :ir01` and suchs from the root directory, but that doesn't always work (screw me if I know why)
